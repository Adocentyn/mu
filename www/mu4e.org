  Starting with version 0.9.8, [[http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu][mu]] provides an emacs-based e-mail client which
  uses =mu= for its back-end: *mu4e*. It's been in use (by the author) for a few
  months already, but 0.9.8 is the first public release.

  Based on =mu=, =mu4e= sits on top of your Maildir (which you update with
  e.g. =offlineimap= or =fetchmail=). =mu4e= is designed to enable
  super-efficient handling of e-mail; searching, reading, replying, moving,
  deleting. The overall 'feel' is a bit of a mix of =dired= and [[http://www.gohome.org/wl/][Wanderlust]].

  For all the details, please see the [[file:mu4e/index.html][manual]]. Or check the screenshots below.
