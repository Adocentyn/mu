* Old news

  - [2010-12-05] *mu version 0.9.1* released; fixes a couple of issues users
    found with a missing icon, the unit-tests.
  - [2010-12-04] *mu version 0.9* released. Compared to the b√®ta-release, there
    were a number of improvements to the documentation and the unit
    tests. Pre-processing queries is a little bit smarter now, making matching
    e-mail address more eager. Experimental support for Fedora-14.
  - [2010-11-27] *mu version 0.9-beta* released. New features: searching is now
    accent-insensitive; you can now search for message priority (=prio:=),
    time-interval (=date:=) and message flags (=flag:=). Also, you can now store
    ('bookmark') often-used queries. To top it off, there is a simple graphical
    UI now, called =mug=. Documentation has been update, and all known bugs have
    been fixed.
  - [2010-10-30] *mu version 0.8* released, with only some small cosmetic
    updates compared to 0.8-beta. Hurray!
  - [2010-10-23] *mu version 0.8-beta* released. The new version brings =mu
     extract= for getting the attachments from messages, improved searching
     (matching is a bit more 'greedy'), updated and extended documentation,
     including the =mu-easy= manpage with simple examples. All known
     non-enhancement bugs were fixed.
  - [2010-02-27] *mu version 0.7* released. Compared to the beta version, there
    are few changes. The maildir-matching syntax now contains a starting =/=, so
    =~/Maildir/foo/bar/(cur|new)/msg= can be matched with =m:/foo/bar=. The
    top-level maildir can be matched with =m:/=. Apart from that, there are so
    small cosmetic fixes and documentation updates.
  - [2010-02-11] *mu version 0.7-beta* released. A lot of changes:
	- Automatic database scheme version check, notifies users when an
          upgrade is needed
        - Adds the =mu view= command, to view mail message files
        - Removes the 10K match limit
        - Support for unattended upgrades - that is, the database can
          automatically be upgraded (=--autoupgrade=). Also, the log file is
          automatically cleaned when it gets too big (unless you use
          =--nocleanup=)
        - Search for a certain Maildir using the =maildir:=,=m:= search
          prefixes. For example, you can find all messages located in
          =~/Maildir/foo/bar/(cur|new)/msg= with =m:foo/bar=. This replaces the
          search for path/p in 0.6
        - Fixes for reported issues #17 and #18
        - A test suite with a growing number of unit tests
        - Updated documentation
        - Many internal refactoring and other changes 
   This version has been
   tagged as =v0.7-beta= in repository, and must be considered a code-complete
   preview of the upcoming release 0.7. Please report any problems you encounter
   with it.
