* Mu Cheatsheet

Here are some tips for using =mu=. If you want to know more, please refer to the
=mu= man pages. For a quick warm-up, there's the =mu-easy= man-page.

** Indexing your mail

  You can index your mail with:
#+begin_src sh
   $ mu index
#+end_src

  If =mu= did not guess the right Maildir, you can set it explicitly:
#+begin_src sh
   $ mu index --maildir=~/MyMaildir
#+end_src
  
  If you want to exclude certain directories from being indexed (for example,
  directories with spam-messages), put a file called =.noindex= in the directory
  to exlude, and it will be ignored when indexing (including its children)

** Finding messages

   After you have indexed your messages, you can search them. Here are some
   examples.

*** messages about Helsinki

#+begin_src sh
   $ mu find Helsinki
#+end_src

*** messages to Jack with subject jellyfish containing the word tumbleweed

#+begin_src sh
   $ mu find to:Jack subject:jellyfish tumbleweed
#+end_src

*** messages between 2 kilobytes and a 2Mb, written in December 2009 with an attachment from Bill

#+begin_src sh
   $ mu find size:2k..2m date:20091201..20093112 flag:attach from:bill
#+end_src
 
*** unread messages about soccer or socrates or ...

#+begin_src sh
   $ mu find 'subject:soc*' flag:unread
#+end_src


    

** Further processing of matched messages

  If you need to process the results of your queries with some other program,
  you can return the results as a list of absolute paths to the messages found:

  For example, to get the number of lines in all your messages mentioning
  /banana/, you could use something like:

#+begin_src sh
   $ mu find --fields="'l'" banana | xargs wc -l
#+end_src

  Note that we use ='l'=, so the returned message paths will be quoted. This is
  useful if you have maildirs with spaces in their names.
    
  For further processing, also the ~--format=(xml|json|sexp)~ may be
  interesting.
   
** Integration with mail clients

  See the example in the =mu-find= man page.
