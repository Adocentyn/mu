* Mu Cheatsheet

Here are some tips for using =mu=. If you want to know more, please refer to the
=mu= man pages. For a quick warm-up, there's the =mu-easy= man-page.

** Indexing your mail

  You can index your mail with:
#+begin_src sh
   $ mu index
#+end_src

  If =mu= did not guess the right Maildir, you can set it explicitly:
#+begin_src sh
   $ mu index --maildir=~/MyMaildir
#+end_src
  
  If you want to exclude certain directories from being indexed (for example,
  directories with spam-messages), put a file called =.noindex= in the directory
  to exlude, and it will be ignored when indexing (including its children)

** Finding messages

   After you have indexed your messages, you can search them. Here are some
   examples.

*** messages about Helsinki (in message body, subject, sender, ...)

#+begin_src sh
   $ mu find Helsinki
#+end_src

*** messages to Jack with subject jellyfish containing the word tumbleweed

#+begin_src sh
   $ mu find to:Jack subject:jellyfish tumbleweed
#+end_src

*** messages between 2 kilobytes and a 2Mb, written in December 2009 with an attachment from Bill

#+begin_src sh
   $ mu find size:2k..2m date:20091201..20093112 flag:attach from:bill
#+end_src
 
*** unread messages about soccer or socrates or ...

#+begin_src sh
   $ mu find 'subject:soc*' flag:unread
#+end_src

** Retrieving attachments from messages
   

   You can retrieve attachments from messages using =mu extract=, which takes a
   message file as an argument. Without any other arguments, it displays the
   MIME-parts of the message. You can then get specific attachments:

#+begin_src sh
   $ mu extract --parts=3,4 my-msg-file
#+end_src

   will get you parts 3 and 4. You can also extract files based on their name:

#+begin_src sh
   $ mu extract my-msg-file '.*\.jpg'
#+end_src

   The second argument is a case-insensitive regular expression, and the command
   will extract any files matching the pattern -- in the example, all
   =.jpg=-files.
   


** Further processing of matched messages

  If you need to process the results of your queries with some other program,
  you can return the results as a list of absolute paths to the messages found:

  For example, to get the number of lines in all your messages mentioning
  /banana/, you could use something like:

#+begin_src sh
   $ mu find --fields="'l'" banana | xargs wc -l
#+end_src

  Note that we use ='l'=, so the returned message paths will be quoted. This is
  useful if you have maildirs with spaces in their names.
    
  For further processing, also the ~--format=(xml|json|sexp)~ may be
  interesting.
   
** Integration with mail clients

  The =mu-find= man page contains examples for =mutt= and =wanderlust=.
