* Welcome to mu!

  Given the /enormous/ amounts of e-mail many people gather and the importance
  of e-mail message in our work-flows, it's essential to quickly deal with all
  that mail - in particular, to instantly find that one important e-mail you
  need right now.
  
  *mu* is a tool for dealing with e-mail messages stored in the
  [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir][Maildir]]-format. *mu*'s main purpose is to help you to quickly find the
  messages you need; in addition, it allows you to view messages, extract
  attachments, create new maildirs, ... See the [[file:cheatsheet.org][mu cheatsheet]] for some examples.
  
  Searching works by first indexing your messages into a [[http://xapian.org/][Xapian]]-database, which
  can then be queried using a custom query language.

   - 2011-07-31: mu *0.9.7-pre* is now available with a number of interesting
     new features and fixes, many based on user suggestions. =mu= now supports
     /mail threading/ based on the [[http://www.jwz.org/doc/threading.html][JWZ-algorithm]]; output is now automatically
     converted to the user-locale; =mu view= can output separators between
     messages for easier processing, support for X-Label-tags, and last but not
     least, =mu= now has bindings for the [[http://www.gnu.org/s/guile/][Guile]] (Scheme) programming language -
     there is a new toy (=toys/muile=) that allows you to inspect messages and
     do all kinds of statistics - see the [[https://gitorious.org/mu/mu/blobs/master/toys/muile/README][README]] for more information.

     Note, the repository name has changed, it's now at: https://gitorious.org/mu/mu.
    

   - 2011-06-02: after quite a bit of testing, *0.9.6* has been promoted to be
     the next release -- forget about the 'bèta'. Development continues for
     the next release.

   - 2011-05-28: *mu-0.9.6* (bèta). A lot of internal changes, but also quite
     some new features, for example:
     - wild-card searching for most fields: mu find 'car*'
     - search for message with certain attachments with 'attach:/a:': mu find
       'attach:resume*'
     - color for =mu find=, =mu cfind=, =mu extract= and =mu view= 
     Everything is documented in the man-pages, and there are examples in the [[file:cheatsheet.org][mu
     cheatsheet]].

   - 2011-04-25: *mu-0.9.5* a small, but important, bugfix in maildir-detection,
     some small optimizations.

   - 2011-04-12: *mu 0.9.4* released - adds the =cfind= command, to find
     contacts (name + e-mail); add =flag:unread= which is a synonym for
     =flag:new OR NOT flag:seen=. Updates to the documentation and some internal
     updates. This is a *bèta-version*.

   - 2011-02-13: *mu 0.9.3*; fixes a bunch of minor issues in 0.9.2; updated the
     web page with pages for [[file:mug.org][mug]] (the experimental UI) and the [[file:cheatsheet.org][mu cheatsheet]].
     
   - 2011-02-02: *mu 0.9.2* released, which adds support for matching on message
     size, and various new output format. See [[http://gitorious.org/mu/mu/blobs/master/NEWS][NEWS]] for all the user-visible
     changes, also from older releases.

   - [[file:old-news.org][Old news]]
     
** Features

   - fast indexing for Maildir, Maildir+ and Maildir-on-VFAT
   - search for messages based on the sender, receiver, message subject, size,
     priority, words in the message body, attachments, date range, flags
     (signed, encrypted, new, replied, unread, ...), message-id, maildir
   - known to work on Linux (Ubuntu/Fedora/Debian/Gentoo), FreeBSD, MacOS,
     Solaris, ...
   - fully documented (man pages)
   - can be integrated with e-mail clients; documentation has examples for [[http://www.mutt.org/][mutt]]
     and [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WanderLust][Wanderlust]].
