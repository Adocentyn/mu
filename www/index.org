* Welcome to mu!

  Given the /enormous/ amounts of e-mail many people gather, and the importance
  of e-mail message in our work-flows, it's essential to quickly deal with all
  that mail - in particular, to instantly find that one important e-mail you
  need right now.
  
  *mu* is a tool for dealing with e-mail messages stored in the
  [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir][Maildir]]-format. *mu*'s main purpose is to help you to quickly find the
  messages you need; in addition, it allows you to view messages, extract
  attachments, create new maildirs, ... See the [[file:cheatsheet.org][mu cheatsheet]] for some examples.
  
  Searching works by first indexing your messages into a [[http://xapian.org/][Xapian]]-database, which
  can then be queried using a custom query language.
