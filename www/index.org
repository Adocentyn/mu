* Welcome to mu!

  With the /enormous/ amounts of e-mail many people gather and the importance of
  e-mail messages in our daily work-flow, it is very important to be able to
  quickly deal with all that - in particular, to instantly find that one
  important e-mail you need right now.

  For that, *mu* was created.  *mu* is a tool for dealing with e-mail messages
  stored in the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir][Maildir]]-format, on Unix-like systems. *mu*'s main purpose is to
  help you to find the messages you need, quickly; in addition, it allows you to
  view messages, extract attachments, create new maildirs, ... See the [[file:cheatsheet.org][mu
  cheatsheet]] for some examples.

  *mu* now comes with an emacs-based e-mail client (=mu4e=), a simple GUI
  (=mug=) and bindings for the Guile/Scheme programming language.

** Features

   - fast indexing for Maildir, Maildir+ and Maildir-on-VFAT
   - search for messages based on the sender, receiver, subject, date range,
     size, priority, words in message, flags (signed, encrypted, new, replied,
     has-attachment,...), message-id, maildir, tags, attachment (name,
     mime-type, text) and more
   - command-line tools for indexing, searching, viewing, extracting
     attachments, exporting address lists, creating maildirs, ...
   - accent/case normalization - so /angstrom/ will match /Ångström/.
   - can be integrated with other e-mail clients such as [[http://www.mutt.org/][mutt]] and [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WanderLust][Wanderlust]].
   - [[file:mu4e.html][mu4e]], an emacs-based e-mail client based on =mu=
   - [[file:mu-guile.html][mu-guile]]: guile-bindings that allow for scripting, advanced processing of
     your data
   -
   - fully documented (man pages, info pages)

   - 2011-07-31: mu *0.9.7-pre* is now available with a number of interesting
     new features and fixes, many based on user suggestions. =mu= now supports

     converted to the user-locale; =mu view= can output separators between
     messages for easier processing, support for X-Label-tags, and last but not
     least, =mu= now has bindings for the [[http://www.gnu.org/s/guile/][Guile]] (Scheme) programming language -
     there is a new toy (=toys/muile=) that allows you to inspect messages and
     do all kinds of statistics - see the [[https://gitorious.org/mu/mu/blobs/master/toys/muile/README][README]] for more information.

     Note, the repository name has changed, it's now at: https://gitorious.org/mu/mu.


   - 2011-06-02: after quite a bit of testing, *0.9.6* has been promoted to be

     some new features, for example:

       'attach:resume*'
     - color for =mu find=, =mu cfind=, =mu extract= and =mu view=
     Everything is documented in the man-pages, and there are examples in the [[file:cheatsheet.org][mu
