  The toy here is called 'procmule', which tries to offer procmail[1]-like
  functionality from mu, with the procmailrc configuration language replaced
  with guile and the mu-guile-bindings.

  Of course, I'm not arrogant enough to claim that I can replace a time-tested,
  classical Unix tool so easily. On the other hand, I'm gluing existing tools
  together.

  Now, the big difference with procmail is that procmail is an MDA - a mail
  delivery agent. In practice, it typically reads a new e-mail message from
  standard input (it's called from the local mail daemon), and then decides what
  to do with it.

  In contrast, procmule watches a directory (or series of directories) for
  changes - as soon as a new message appears in one of these directories,
  procmule evaluates a Guile/Scheme program (typically, ~/.mu/procmule.scm) with
  the message available as 'mu:current-msg'.
