Welcome to mu!
--------------

Given the enormous amounts of e-mail many people gather and the importance of
e-mail message in our work-flows, it's essential to quickly deal with all that
mail - in particular, to instantly find that one important e-mail you need right
now.

mu[1] is a tool for dealing with e-mail messages stored in the Maildir-format. mu's
main purpose is to help you to quickly find the messages you need; in addition,
it allows you to view messages, extract attachments, create new maildirs, â€¦ See
the mu cheatsheet[2] for some examples.

Searching works by first indexing your messages into a Xapian-database, which
can then be queried using a custom query language.

Built on top of mu there are some extensions:

  * mu-for-emacs (mu4e): a full-features e-mail client that runs inside emacs
  * mu-guile: bindings for the Guile/Scheme programming language

Mu is primarily written in C and a bit of C++, with parts of mu4e written in
Emacs-lisp and mu-guile in Scheme.

Note, mu is available in Debian/Ubuntu under the name "maildir-utils" because
they don't like short names.
