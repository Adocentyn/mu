.SH NAME 

mu mv\-  move a message file to a Maildir 

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B mu mv <source-path> <target-maildir>

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBmu mv\fR is the \fBmu\fR sub-command for moving mail files to new
directories. It does \fBnot\fR use the mu database. The command is
deliberately limited and tries hard to maintain the Maildir-integrity and to
minimize chance of accidents

The \fIsource-path\fR must be a full, absolute path to the message you want to
move, while the \fItarget-maildir\fR is the path to the maildir, but
\fBwithout\fR the 'cur' or 'new' part - that part will be constructed from the
source message, so that message that live in 'new' will also be in 'new' in
the target, and the same for 'cur'. If needed, consult the \fBmaildir(5)\fR
documentation for details about 'cur' and 'new'.

As a special case, when \fI/dev/null\fR is specified as the target directory,
the mail file will be unlinked (deleted).

Note, unlike the UNIX \fImv\fR command, \fImu mv\fR takes precisely two
parameters. It's recommended not to use wildcards on the shell, the result may
be unexpected.

.SH EXAMPLE

To move a message \fI/home/jimbo/Maildir/scuba/cur/123123123:2,S\fR to
\fI/home/jimbo/Maildir/archive\fR, you can use:

.nf
   mu mv /home/jimbo/Maildir/scuba/cur/123123123:2,S /home/jimbo/Maildir/archive
.fi

This will move the message to the new path:
\fI/home/jimbo/Maildir/archive/cur/123123123:2,S\fR.

To remove a message \fI/home/fred/Maildir/trash/cur/123123123:2,S\fR, you
could do:

.nf
   mu mv /home/fred/Maildir/trash/cur/123123123:2,S /dev/null
.fi

Obviously, you could also simply use \fBrm\fR in this case.

.SH LIMITATIONS

Both source-path and target-directory must be on the same disk partition,
except when the target-directory is \fI/dev/null\fR.

.SH OPTIONS

\fBmu mv\fR takes no options.
