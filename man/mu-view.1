mu view\- display an e-mail message file

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B mu view [options] <file> [<files>]

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBmu view\fR is the \fBmu\fR sub-command for displaying an e-mail message
file. It works on files, and does not require the message to be indexed before
using
.BR mu-index(1)
\.

Currently, the command shows some common headers (From:, To:, Cc:, Subject:
and Date:) and the plain-text body of the message.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-summary\-len\fR=\fI<len>\fR
instead of the full message, output a summary based on up to \fI\len\fR lines
of the message. The default is
.B 0
, which means 'show full body'.
