.TH MU CLEANUP 1 "August 2010" "User Manuals"

.SH NAME 

mu cleanup \- clean up the mu database

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B mu cleanup [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBmu cleanup\fR is the \fBmu\fR sub-command for removing messages from the mu
database that are no longer present in the file system.

The \fBcleanup\fR command removes messages for which no corresponding file can
be found, from the database. Note that this is done automatically when running
\fBmu index\fR (unless \fB\-\-nocleanup\fR was specified). 

.SH ENVIRONMENT

Like \fBmu index\fR, \fBmu cleanup\fR uses \fBMAILDIR\fR to find the user's
Maildir if it has not been specified explicitly
\fB\-\-maildir\fR=\fI<maildir>\fR. If MAILDIR is not set, \fBmu cleanup\fR will
try \fI~/Maildir\fR.
