.TH MU 1 "December 2009" "User Manuals"
.SH NAME 
mu \- index and search the contents of e-mail messages stored in Maildirs

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mu <command> [options] [parameter(s)]  

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mu
is a set of tools for indexing and searching e-mail messages stored in
Maildirs. It does so by recursively scanning a Maildir directory tree and
analyzing the e-mail messages found. The results of this analysis are then
stored in a database. Using this database, you can quickly search for specific
messages.

.B mu
also offers functionality for creating maildirs.

The various tools are available as commands for a single
.B mu
executable.

.SH COMMANDS
.B mu
offers the following commands:

.TP
\fBindex\fR
for indexing (analyzing) the contents of your Maildirs, and storing the
information in a database

.TP
\fBfind\fR
for finding messages in your database, using certain search parameters (see
below for details). You can use \fBquery\fR and \fBsearch\fR as synonyms for
\fBfind\fR.

.TP
\fBcleanup\fR
for removing messages from your database for which there is no corresponding
message file anymore. This commonly happens when you delete or move messages.

.TP
\fBmkdir\fR
for creating Maildirs.

.SH THE INDEX COMMAND
Using the
.B index
command, you can index your Maildir directories, and store the information in
a Xapian database. 

.B index
understands Maildirs as defined by Dan Bernstein for qmail(7). It also
understands recursive Maildirs (Maildirs within Maildirs), and the
VFAT-version of Maildir, as used by Tinymail/Modest.

E-mail messages which are not stored in something that looks like a Maildir
leaf directory are ignored.

Currently, symlinks are not followed.

If there is a file called
.B .noindex
in a directory, the contents of that directory and any of its subdirectories
will be ignored. This can be useful to exclude certain directories from the
indexing process, for example directories with spam-messages. 

The first run of 
.B mu index
may take a few minutes if you have a lot of mail (ten thousands of messages).
Note that a full scan has to be done only once, after that it suffices to
index the changes, which goes much faster.

.SS Indexing options

.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-maildir\fR=\fI<maildir>\fR start searching
at\fI<maildir>\fR. By default,
.B mu
uses whatever the
.B MAILDIR
environment variable is set to; if that is not set, it tries
.B ~/Maildir
\.

.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-reindex\fR
re-index all mails, even ones that are already in the database.

.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-cleanup\fR automatically clean up the database after
indexing. This is equivalent to calling the
.B cleanup
command after indexing. Please see the information for
.B cleanup
for details.

.TP

.B NOTE:
It is probably not a good idea to run multiple instances of
.B mu index
concurrently. No data loss should occur, but one or more of the instances may
experience errors due to database locks.

Also note that, before indexing is completed, searches for messages may fail,
even if they have already been indexed, as some of the esssential database
information will only be written in batches during the indexing process.

.SH THE FIND COMMAND

The
.B find
command starts a search for a specific message in the database.


.SS find options

.SS query syntax
In its simplest form, you can just can just specify a number of words, and
.B mu
will search for messages that match all of those words. So,
.nf
 $ mu find monkey banana
.fi
will find all messages which have both "monkey" AND "banana" in one of those
fields.

.SH THE CLEANUP COMMAND


.SH THE MKDIR COMMAND

.SH OPTIONS
.B mu
has a number of general options, which work with all the commands.

.B --maildir=, -m
.I <maildir>
set the full path to the maildir; note that you can also specify this path as
a non-option argument to 
.B
mu-index
; if you use both, the non-option argument wins.

.B --quiet|-q
makes 
.B mu-index
not put out any progress info during its indexing. This is not the default, as
running may take quite some time, and might confuse novice users.

.SS General options
.B --home=, -h 
.I <dir>
sets the
.B mu 
home directory; default is 
.I ~/.mu
\. This directory is where the message database
is stored, as well as configuration files and logs.

.B --log-stderr, -s
write logging information to standard error instead of to 
.I <mu-home-directory>/mu-find.log, 
which is the default.


.B --debug, -d 
add a lot of logging for debugging purposes


.B mu-index
processes messages in
.B cur/
and
.B new/
leaf directories; it will ignore messages in
.B tmp/

Thus,
.B [....]/tmp/msg02
will be ignored, while
.B [....]/new/msg01
won't. 

On the other hand,
.B [....]/tmp/cur/msg03
would not be ignored, while
.B [....]/cur/tmp/msg04
would.

Note: single messages that are added by providing their full pathname to
.B mu-index
will not have their path checked.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
As mentioned,
.B mu index
uses 
.B MAILDIR
to find the user's Maildir if it has not been specified explicitly. If
.B MAILDIR
is not set, 
.B mu index
will try 
.B $HOME/Maildir
.
