* TODO (fixes, ideas, etc.)


** Future stuff

*** mu4e

  - identities (see Jacek's 'mu4e: From field in replies' mail)
  - mu4e~view-wrap-lines (use visual-line-mode? see Jacek's mu4e~view-wrap-lines
    mail)
  - contact completion (see Jacek's 'mu4e: using' mail)

  - rich text composing (with org-mode)

  - actions for /all/ headers, actions for /all/ attachment
  - custom header fields in headers-view, message-view
  - guile integration

  - check if we can speed up mu4e-proc parsing by using search rather than
    regexp search
  - show maildirs as a tree, not a list in speed bar
  - put threading information in the database, and enable getting the complete
    threads when searching
  - mark message, decide what to do with them later
  - sorting
  - refactor fill_database function in test cases

  - *FIX* having multiple header views visible
  - *FIX* add runtime check for imagemagick
  - *FIX* fix for strings where len (g_utf8_strdown (str)) > len (str)


** Done

  - make next/prev header respect prefix argument (Jacek's patch)
  - make search results a stack (well, multiple stacks)
  - optionally keep cc with user's email
  - enable setting/unsetting 'Flagged' on messages
  - allow narrowing of search results
  - interactive split-view control (Jacek)
  - *bug*: reply-to does not make it the frontend
  - view images inline
  - *FIX* slow maildirs when there are many
